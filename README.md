# 🚛 Intelligent Truck & Plate Recognition System

A real-time Flask web application for detecting trucks and recognizing license plates using YOLOv8 and OCR technologies. Designed to control access based on vehicle type and license plate verification against a local database. Supports mobile and PC webcams, and offers a responsive web UI for field use.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop a smart security system capable of:

- Detecting trucks in real-time video  
- Extracting and recognizing license plates  
- Matching recognized plates with a registered whitelist  
- Triggering access (gate open) or denial (buzzer alert) decisions  
- Providing a responsive web interface for monitoring and registration  

---

## 📸 Live Demo Overview

- ✅ Detects trucks only (cars are rejected)  
- ✅ Reads the plate via OCR  
- ✅ Grants access if the plate is registered  
- ✅ Blocks access if the plate is unknown  
- ✅ Rejects cars with warning  
- ✅ Web interface displays video + messages  
- ✅ Extra page to register new plates

## 📱 Mobile Camera Usage (Optional)

You can stream your phone's camera to the PC:

- **Android**: Install [DroidCam](https://www.dev47apps.com/)  
- **iOS**: Use [EpocCam](https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam) or [NDI HX Camera](https://www.ndi.tv/tools/)

Update this line in `app.py`:

camera_source = "http://<your_phone_ip>:4747/video"


## 🔐 Access Logic

| Vehicle Type | Plate Registered? | Action           |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Truck        | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Access Granted |
| Truck        | ❌ No             | ❌ Access Denied  |
| Car          | ❌ Irrelevant     | 🔔 Buzzer Alert   |
